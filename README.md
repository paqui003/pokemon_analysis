# pokemon_analysis

This project is about learning scrapy and analyzing a simple pokemon database using common Data-Science tools. 

1. First we will scrape the data from https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all.
2. We will extract label information about legendary or non-legendary pokemons. 
3. Visualize and describe the data (Data Exploration)
4. Clean the Data
4. Use a Machine Learning algorithm to extract useful knowledge about the pokemon database. That is, what 
   makes a Pokemon legendary. (Model Training)
5. Use the extracted knowledge to train another model and use it for classification.
6. Train a neural network to classify pokemon types based on a pokemon's picture (optional)
